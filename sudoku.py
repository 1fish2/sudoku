This program uses the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The
backtracking algorithm works by first trying all possible solutions for a given
cell. If no solution is found, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different
solution for the cell. This process continues until a solution is found or all
possible solutions have been tried.

The time complexity of this program is O(9!), which is the number of possible
Sudoku puzzles. The space complexity of this program is O(9^2), which is the
space required to store the board."""
